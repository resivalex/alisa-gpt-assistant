# üîä Alisa GPT Assistant

Integration of OpenAI's GPT Assistant with Yandex Alisa via dialogs.yandex.ru.

## üìã Usage

### Triggers

- **‚ú® Start**: Begins a new session. The assistant sends a welcome message, signaling readiness.
- **üëÄ Check**: Dual purpose:
   1. Awaiting a response? This prompts an update.
   2. Long response? This continues the reading.
- **üë£Ô∏è Further**: Continues the dialogue, maintaining context for in-depth conversations.

> üí° _Tip: Russian language is preferable for triggers. They are customizable. You can utilize Alisa "scenarios" to make the interaction even more comfortable._
